## Loading and preprocessing data

```{r, include=TRUE}
activity_data <- read.csv("activity.csv")
```

### Omitting na rows
```{r, include=TRUE}
activity_no_NA <- na.omit(activity_data)
```

## Steps per day

### Aggregating steps on for days
```{r, include=TRUE}
sinad <- aggregate(steps ~ date, activity_no_NA, sum) 
```

### Drawing a histogram of the number of steps in a day
```{r, include=TRUE}
hist(sinad[,2], breaks=26, col="green", main="Histogram of steps in a day", xlab="Steps")
```

### Summarizing the steps per day data
```{r, include=TRUE}
summary(sinad[,2])
```

## Average daily pattern

### Aggregating data on interval

```{r, include=TRUE}
sinint <- aggregate(steps ~ interval, activity_no_NA, sum) 
```
## Plotting the activity
```{r, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
plot(sinint, type='l', col="blue", main="Activity in time interval in a day")
```


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
